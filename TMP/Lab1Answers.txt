Ans 1) 
Advantages -
	Aging Based Scheduler - The process eliminates the problem of starvation as seen by the default Xinu Scheduler.
	increasing the priority by 1 each time resched is called, push lower priority processes in the ready queue
	to higher priority compared to the currently executing process thus context switching takes place

	Linux Based Scheduler - The Scheduler allots every process a quantum within every epoch. Therefore, all
	processes in the system will run for every epoch.

Disadvantages -
	Aging Based Scheduler - This scheduler leads to priority inversion which adversely by stalling higher priority
	processes for a long time.

	Linux Based Scheduler - The scheduler implements a complex algorithm of the order O(cn) which increases the
	overhead of every process.

Ans 2)
Aging Based Scheduler -
    Null process is excluded from the priority increment logic of the scheduler. The null process only runs once all
    processes have expired.

    Linux Based Scheduler -
    The null processes is scheduled to run when either all the processes have exhausted their quantum or when there is
    no process ready to run.



Ans 3) 
2 Ways to improve the Aging Based Scheduler would be :

    a)  The Aging based scheduler could be modified to decrease quantum for lower priority processes. This will help
    solve the problem of priority inversion wait time.

    b) We could increase the priority of the process by keeping track of the process which is ready but has executed
    very less than other processes and alot minimal quantum to it as it being the lowest priority process.
